# hololinked - Pythonic Object-Oriented Supervisory Control & Data Acquisition / Internet of Things

`hololinked` is a beginner-friendly server side pythonic tool suited for instrumentation control and data acquisition over network, especially with HTTP. If you have a requirement to control and capture data from your hardware/instrumentation, show the data in a browser/dashboard, provide a GUI or run automated scripts, hololinked can help. Even for isolated applications or a small lab setup without networking concepts, one can still separate the concerns of the tools that interact with the hardware & the hardware itself.
