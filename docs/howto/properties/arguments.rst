Common arguments to all properties 
==================================

``allow_None``, ``constant`` & ``readonly`` 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* if ``allow_None`` is ``True``, property supports ``None`` apart from its own type
* ``readonly`` (being ``True``) makes the property read-only or execute the getter method
* ``constant`` (being ``True``), again makes the property read-only but can be set once if ``allow_None`` is ``True``. 
  This is useful the set the property once at ``__init__()`` but remain constant after that.

``doc`` and ``label``
+++++++++++++++++++++

``doc`` allows clients to fetch a docstring for the property. ``label`` can be used to show the property 
in a GUI for example.  


``default``, ``class_member``, ``fget``, ``fset`` & ``fdel``
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To provide a getter-setter (& deleter) method is optional. If none given, when the property is set/written, the value 
is stored inside the instance's ``__dict__`` under the name `<property name given>_param_value` 
(for example, ``serial_number_param_value`` for ``serial_number``). In layman's terms, 
``__dict__`` is the internal map where the attributes of the object are stored by python. If no such value was stored 
originally because a value assignment was never called on the property, ``default`` is returned.  

If a setter/deleter is given, getter is mandatory. In this case, ``default`` is also ignored & the getter is 
always executed. 
.. If default is desirable, one has to return it manually in the getter method by 
.. accessing the property descriptor object directly. 

.. literalinclude:: ../code/properties/common_args_2.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:
    :start-after: # frame-rate-start
    :end-before: # frame-rate-end


If ``class_member`` is True, the value is set in the class' ``__dict__`` (i.e. becomes a class attribute) 
instead of instance's ``__dict__`` (instance's attribute). 
Custom getter-setter-deleter are not compatible with this option currently. ``class_member`` takes precedence over fget-fset-fdel, 
which in turn has precedence over ``default``.

.. literalinclude:: ../code/properties/common_args_2.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:
    :start-after: # error-codes-start
    :end-before: # error-codes-end

``class_member`` can still be used with a default value if there is no custom fget-fset-fdel. 



``remote``
++++++++++

setting remote to False makes the property local, this is still useful to type-restrict python attributes to 
provide an interface to other developers using your class, for example, when someone else inherits your ``Thing``. 

``URL_path`` and ``http_method``
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This setting is applicable only to the ``HTTPServer``. ``URL_path`` makes the property available for 
getter-setter-deleter methods at the specified URL. The default http request verb/method for getter is GET, 
setter is PUT and deleter is DELETE. If one wants to change the setter to POST method instead of PUT, 
one can set ``http_method = ("GET", "POST", "DELETE")``. Even without the custom getter-setter 
(which generates the above stated internal name for the property), one can modify the ``http_method``. 
Setting any of the request methods to ``None`` makes the property in-accessible for that respective operation.

``state``
+++++++++

When ``state`` is specifed, the property is writeable only when the Thing's StateMachine is in that state (or 
in the list of allowed states). This is also currently applicable only when set operations are called by clients.
Local set operations are always executed irrespective of the state machine state. A get operation is always executed as 
well even from the clients irrespective of the state. 

``observable``
++++++++++++++

Observable properties push change events when the property is set or read. This is useful when one wants to monitor the
property for changes without polling from the client. The payload of the change event is the new value of the property. 

``metadata``
++++++++++++

This dictionary allows storing arbitrary metadata in a dictionary. For example, one can store units of the physical 
quantity. 

``db_init``, ``db_commit`` & ``db_persist``
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Properties can be stored & loaded in a database if necessary when the ``Thing`` is stopped and restarted. 

* ``db_init`` only loads a property from database, when the value is changed, its not written back to the database. 
  For this option, the value has to be pre-created in the database in some other fashion.

* ``db_commit`` only writes the value into the database when an assignment is called. 

* ``db_persist`` both stores and loads the property from the database. 

Supported databases are MySQL, Postgres & SQLite currently. Look at database how-to for supply database configuration.
